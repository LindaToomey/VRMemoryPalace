# MemoryPalaceVR

Final year project based on creating a platform for developers to use Memory Palace spaces for testing in Virtual Reality.

# How to get the Application Up and Running
1. Download Unity Hub (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
2. From Unity Hub, create a Unity account and download Unity 2019.2.0f1
3. Download Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and create an account
4. Clone this project onto a git directory on your computer: 'git clone https://gitlab.cs.nuim.ie/u180336/memorypalacevr.git'
5. From the Unity Hub, navigate to the folder where you cloned the project and import the project folder 'MemoryPalaceApartment'
6. Lauch steam and open SteamVR
7. Open the project by double clicking on it in Unity Hub
8. Once the project is opened, navigate to the 'Complete Floor Plan A' scene within the project panel in the Unity editor and open it.
9. Press the play button near the top of the Unity editor screen, with SteamVR and the VR headset running, to preview the project

Note: This project is meant to be used with a VR headset and much of the functionality will not work without one. 
A version with limited functionality can be played on a desktop with a keyboard and mouse by following the instructions below.

# How to run the application with LIMITED functionality on a regular PC
1. Open the unity project by following the steps above.
2. Navigate to the 'Complete Floor Plan A' scene within the project panel in the Unity editor and open it.
3. Select the '[CameraRig] Variant' game object in the project hierarchy panel.
4. In the inspector panel, deactivate the game object by unticking the box to the left of the object name
5. In the search bar in the project panel, type in 'Player'. A blue arrow object should appear.
6. Drag the blue arrow object into the game window and place it somewhere within the environment.
7. Press the play button. The game window should allow you to navigate through the house using w/a/s/d/e/q and the right mouse button.

This version of the project for a regular PC does not display the controllers or text tablet, the menu does not function and neither does teleporting or object deletion.
Object interaction is not facilitated by default but can be added in by dragging an object with the 'Ob_' prefix from the 'menuModels' folder into the game window, 
removing all the script components from the object and replacing them with the 'throwable' script (which also automatically adds the interactable script).
This needs to be done for every object you want to interact with.
